# PROJECT_CONTROL.md — TraID

## 0. Purpose

`PROJECT_CONTROL.md` is TraID's compact operational state ledger.

It records the verified current state of the project: active Card, authorization, blockers, checkpoints, gates, evidence status, and safe resume point.

It does not redefine project architecture, Roadmap order, Card contracts, financial/data guardrails, Git policy, or evidence standards.

---

## 1. State Authority

This file must agree with:

```text
repository reality
Git reality
TRAID_V1_ROADMAP.md
TRAID_CARD_SPECIFICATIONS.md
TRAID_CARD_EVIDENCE_MAP.md
explicit human authorization
```

Conflict:

```text
PROJECT_STATE_CONFLICT
STOP
RECONCILE
```

Never invent a convenient state.

---

## 2. Current Project State

```text
Project: TraID
Target: V1
Project Phase: PRE_IMPLEMENTATION / CANONICAL_HARNESS_READY
Active Card: NONE
Active Card State: NOT_STARTED
Last COMPLETE Card: NONE
Next Roadmap Card: V1-C01 — Repository Baseline & Engineering Harness
Next Card Authorized: NO
Implementation Authorization: NONE
Live Trade Execution: PROHIBITED
Human Final Authority: YES
```

The state above is a control checkpoint, not a repository implementation claim.

---

## 3. Harness Redesign State

Final V1 governance surface:

```text
1. AGENTS.md
2. PROJECT_PROFILE.md
3. PROJECT_CONTROL.md
4. TRAID_V1_ROADMAP.md
5. TRAID_CARD_SPECIFICATIONS.md
6. TRAID_CARD_EVIDENCE_MAP.md
7. GIT_WORKFLOW.md
8. TRAID_ENGINEERING_HARNESS.md
9. FINANCIAL_AND_DATA_GUARDRAILS.md
10. .agents/skills/traid-card-execution/SKILL.md
```

Current redesign checkpoint:

```text
AGENTS.md: CANONICAL / CROSS-CHECK PASS
PROJECT_PROFILE.md: CANONICAL / CROSS-CHECK PASS
PROJECT_CONTROL.md: CANONICAL / CURRENT FILE
TRAID_V1_ROADMAP.md: CANONICAL / CROSS-CHECK PASS
TRAID_CARD_SPECIFICATIONS.md: CANONICAL / CROSS-CHECK PASS
TRAID_CARD_EVIDENCE_MAP.md: CANONICAL / CROSS-CHECK PASS
GIT_WORKFLOW.md: CANONICAL / CROSS-CHECK PASS
TRAID_ENGINEERING_HARNESS.md: CANONICAL / CROSS-CHECK PASS
FINANCIAL_AND_DATA_GUARDRAILS.md: CANONICAL / CROSS-CHECK PASS
.agents/skills/traid-card-execution/SKILL.md: CANONICAL / CROSS-CHECK PASS
```

Canonical Harness installation is not implementation evidence; implementation
and Git reality still require the V1-C01 baseline inspection.

---

## 4. Repository / Git Reality

Current verified filesystem state:

```text
Repository Path: /Users/jo.soroush/john/my_projhects/TraID
Repository Root: VERIFIED
Canonical Harness Installation: VERIFIED
Canonical Harness Files: 10 / 10 PRESENT
Harness Structure: VERIFIED
Research / Reconnaissance Organization: VERIFIED
Implementation: NOT STARTED
Source Code: NOT PRESENT
Tests: NOT PRESENT
Git Repository: NOT INITIALIZED
Git Branch: NOT AVAILABLE
Git HEAD: NOT AVAILABLE
Git Safe Checkpoint: NOT AVAILABLE — Git not initialized
V1-C01: NOT_STARTED
V1-C01 Authorization: NOT_GRANTED
```

Filesystem verification is not implementation evidence. Runtime, test, and
Git delivery claims require their own executed evidence.

V1-C01 must establish actual repository evidence.

---

## 5. Canonical Card States

Use:

```text
NOT_STARTED
IN_PROGRESS
BLOCKED
COMPLETE
DEFERRED
```

Optional review annotation:

```text
READY_FOR_HUMAN_REVIEW
CLOSED / PASS
```

`COMPLETE` requires evidence and the exact Card Quality Gate.

---

## 6. Active Card Record

Maintain when a Card is active:

```text
Card ID:
Title:
State:
Branch:
Start Commit:
Safe Checkpoint:
Engineering Goal:
Learning Goal:
Authorized Scope:
Out of Scope:
Dependencies:
Source/Provenance Obligations:
Financial/Data Guardrails:
Security Requirements:
Focused Validation:
Exit Gate:
ROADMAP_ALIGNMENT_GATE:
CARD_QUALITY_GATE:
Blockers:
Known Limitations:
Human Start Approval:
```

Current:

```text
Card ID: NONE
Title: NONE
State: NOT_STARTED
Branch: NOT VERIFIED
Start Commit: NOT VERIFIED
Safe Checkpoint: NOT VERIFIED
Engineering Goal: NONE
Learning Goal: NONE
Authorized Scope: NONE
Out of Scope: ALL IMPLEMENTATION until V1-C01 is explicitly authorized
Dependencies: N/A
Source/Provenance Obligations: N/A
Financial/Data Guardrails: global V1 guardrails remain applicable
Security Requirements: no secrets; no trading credentials; no wallet private keys; no live execution
Focused Validation: N/A
Exit Gate: N/A
ROADMAP_ALIGNMENT_GATE: NOT_RUN
CARD_QUALITY_GATE: NOT_RUN
Blockers: final Harness redesign/install + repository inspection + Card-start approval
Known Limitations: actual repository state not inspected in this session
Human Start Approval: NOT_GRANTED
```

---

## 7. Authorization Ledger

```text
Card Start: NOT_GRANTED
Next Card: NOT_GRANTED
Architecture Change: NOT_GRANTED
Material Scope Change: NOT_GRANTED
Significant Technology Addition: NOT_GRANTED
Sensitive Credential Use: NOT_GRANTED
External Write/Action Capability: NOT_GRANTED
Live Execution Capability: PROHIBITED IN V1
Commit: NOT_GRANTED
Push: NOT_GRANTED
PR: NOT_GRANTED
Merge: NOT_GRANTED
Force Push/History Rewrite: NOT_GRANTED
Deployment/Release: NOT_GRANTED
```

Read-only inspection is allowed.

Routine reversible implementation is allowed only inside an explicitly approved active Card after its alignment gate passes.

---

## 8. Roadmap Position

```text
Approved V1 Cards: 27
Completed Cards: NONE
Active Card: NONE
Next Roadmap Card: V1-C01
Later Cards: NOT AUTHORIZED
```

Being next in sequence is not authorization.

---

## 9. Card Transition Rule

```text
explicit Card-start approval
→ ROADMAP_ALIGNMENT_GATE PASS
→ IN_PROGRESS
→ bounded implementation + validation + evidence
→ exact Exit Gate proof
→ CARD_QUALITY_GATE PASS
→ human closure/delivery approval
→ approved Git delivery if applicable
→ post-merge verification if merged
→ COMPLETE
→ Active Card NONE
→ STOP
→ separate explicit approval for next Card
```

Never pre-authorize the next Card.

---

## 10. Current Blockers

```text
B-001: final 10-file Harness redesign is incomplete.
B-002: canonical Harness installation is complete; implementation and Git baseline remain unverified until V1-C01.
B-003: actual repository/Git/runtime baseline is not verified in this session.
B-004: V1-C01 Card-start approval is NOT_GRANTED.
```

These are control blockers, not claims that the repository is broken.

---

## 11. Blocker Record

For each material blocker:

```text
Blocker ID:
Card:
Detected:
Category:
Description:
Observed Evidence:
Impact:
Root Cause:
Known:
Unknown:
Required Resolution:
Owner:
Status:
Resolution Evidence:
```

No blocker becomes resolved without evidence.

---

## 12. STOP State

Record:

```text
STOP Code:

```

---

## 13. Roadmap Alignment State

Maintain for the active Card:

```text
ROADMAP_ALIGNMENT_GATE:
Timestamp:

Dependency Check:
Repository-State Check:
Duplicate Check:
Ownership Check:
Source/Provenance Check:
Financial/Data Guardrail Check:

```

Current:

```text
ROADMAP_ALIGNMENT_GATE: NOT_RUN
Reason: no active authorized Card
```

---

## 14. Current Bounded Step

```text

```

Current:

```text
Step ID: NONE

```

Only one bounded implementation step should be active at a time.

---

## 15. Contract Map / Risk Map

First implementation step of every new Card:

```text
Contract Map: REQUIRED
Risk Map: REQUIRED
Initial Mapping: READ-ONLY
```

Track:

```text
Contract Map Status:
Risk Map Status:
Important Owners:
Critical Contracts:
Critical Risks:
Unresolved Semantics:
```

Current:

```text
Contract Map Status: NOT_RUN
Risk Map Status: NOT_RUN
Reason: no active Card
```

---

## 16. Source / Provenance State

Current:

```text
No active financially material Card.
Global V1 guardrails remain in force.
```

Unknown material semantics:

```text
FINANCIAL_SEMANTICS_UNVERIFIED
STOP
```

---

## 18. AI / External Intelligence State

Track when applicable:

```text
AI Provider:
Model:
Structured Schema:
Prompt/Schema Version:
Evidence References:
Timeout:
Retry Policy:
Malformed Output:
Failure State:

```

Current:

```text
No active AI/external-intelligence Card.
Bedrock is planned for V1-C14, not active now.
```

---

## 19. Risk / Backtest State

Current implementation evidence:

```text
Risk Gate Implementation: NOT_STARTED
Risk Gate Non-Bypass Evidence: NOT_AVAILABLE
Historical Replay Foundation: NOT_STARTED
Anti-Lookahead Evidence: NOT_AVAILABLE
Backtest Engine Integration: NOT_STARTED
STOP-FIRST Test Evidence: NOT_AVAILABLE
P&L Reconciliation Evidence: NOT_AVAILABLE
Replay Determinism Evidence: NOT_AVAILABLE
```

Architectural requirements already exist, but implementation must not be claimed before evidence.

---

## 20. Test / Evaluation State

Track only tests actually run:

```text
Test/Command:
Card:
Purpose:
Environment:
Timestamp:
Actual Result:
Pass/Fail:
Evidence Reference:
```

Current:

```text
TraID repository test state: NOT VERIFIED IN THIS SESSION
```

An intended or inspected test is not a passed test.

---

## 21. Card Quality Gate State

```

---

## 22. Evidence / Learning State

Detailed evidence belongs in `TRAID_CARD_EVIDENCE_MAP.md`.

This file keeps only:

```text
Latest Evidence Update:
Evidence Card:
Evidence Status:
Critical Missing Proof:
Learning Record Status:

```

Current:

```text
Latest Evidence Update: NOT VERIFIED
Evidence Card: NONE
Evidence Status: PENDING
Critical Missing Proof: repository baseline and all V1 implementation evidence
Learning Record Status: NOT_STARTED

```

Never duplicate or fabricate the Evidence Map here.

---

## 23. Checkpoint / Rollback State

```text

Rollback Path:
```

Current:

```text
Checkpoint Type: NONE VERIFIED
Branch: NOT VERIFIED
Commit/State: NOT VERIFIED
Validation: NOT VERIFIED
Rollback Path: NOT VERIFIED
```

Destructive rollback requires explicit approval.

---

## 24. Git Delivery State

```text

Push: NOT_AUTHORIZED
PR: NONE
PR State: N/A
Human Review: PENDING
Merge Approval: NOT_GRANTED
Merge: NONE

```

Files designed outside the repository are not Git delivery evidence.

---

## 25. Security State

```text
Real Secrets in Repository: MUST BE NO
.env Committed: MUST BE NO
Exchange Trading Credentials: PROHIBITED
Wallet Private Keys: PROHIBITED
Live Execution Endpoint: PROHIBITED
Secret Scan: NOT VERIFIED IN ACTUAL REPOSITORY
Least Privilege: REQUIRED
External Content: UNTRUSTED

```

Actual repository security status must be evidenced in the owning Cards.

---

## 26. Observability / Recovery State

```text
Structured Runtime Observability: NOT YET VERIFIED
Audit Trail: NOT YET VERIFIED
Provider Recovery: NOT YET VERIFIED
AI Failure Recovery: NOT YET VERIFIED
Data-Gap Recovery: NOT YET VERIFIED
```

Architecture intent is not runtime evidence.

---

## 27. Deferred Work Ledger

Format:

```text
Deferred ID:
Originating Card:
Idea:
Reason Deferred:
Target Card / Future Version:
Dependency:
Risk if Forgotten:
```

Current:

```text
No deferred implementation items recorded here.
```

Deferred work is not authorized work.

---

## 28. Decision Ledger

```text
D-001
Decision: V1 is read-only decision support with no live trade execution.
Status: ACTIVE

D-002
Decision: Hyperliquid is the only required V1 live exchange implementation; Core remains provider-neutral.
Status: ACTIVE

D-003
Decision: AI is provider-isolated and cannot override deterministic Strategy/Risk authority.
Status: ACTIVE

D-004
Decision: Risk Gate is mandatory, deterministic, reason-coded, fail-closed, and non-bypassable.
Status: ACTIVE

D-005
Decision: historical evaluation is anti-lookahead; unresolved same-bar stop/target ordering uses STOP FIRST.
Status: ACTIVE

D-006
Decision: Harness remains coding-tool-neutral; tool-specific adapters are optional thin layers.
Status: ACTIVE

D-007
Decision: final V1 governance surface is ten canonical Harness files including one TraID Card-execution Skill.
Status: ACTIVE
```

New material architecture decisions require explicit approval.

---

## 29. External Source Summary

High-level audited roles only:

```text
Hyperliquid Analytics Dashboard → market-data / deterministic analytics reference and ADAPT candidates
HyperStats → Whale / Smart Money methodology reference
Hyperliquid Data Layer API → conditional EVALUATE/ADAPT after exact verification
NEXUS → macro/provider/operational reference
Quant Flow → structured fail-closed AI reference
CryptoRadar → Signal Fusion / detector / Outcome reference
Keel → typed Strategy / validation / agent-safety reference
Hyperliquid Backtester → deterministic replay / anti-lookahead / accounting reference
Hyper Display → UX reference
```

This summary is not source verification.

Exact source decisions belong in Card evidence/source mapping.

Update only from actual evidence.

---

## 31. Resume Protocol

After interruption:

```text
1. Read AGENTS.md.
2. Read PROJECT_PROFILE.md.
3. Read PROJECT_CONTROL.md.
4. Read TRAID_V1_ROADMAP.md.
5. Read the active Card Specification.
6. Read active Card Evidence.
7. Read TRAID_ENGINEERING_HARNESS.md.
8. Read FINANCIAL_AND_DATA_GUARDRAILS.md when relevant.
9. Inspect Git/repository reality.
10. Reconcile mismatch.
11. Re-run ROADMAP_ALIGNMENT_GATE before writing.
```

Never resume implementation from chat summary alone.

---

## 32. Update Rules

Update Project Control on meaningful transitions:

```text
Card start
Card block/unblock
bounded-step checkpoint
material approved decision
source/provenance blocker
Quality Gate result
ready-for-human-review
commit/push/PR/merge approval state
post-merge verification
Card completion
next-Card authorization
material deferral
```

Do not update it for every trivial edit.

---

## 33. State Integrity

Never write:

```text
COMPLETE
PASS
VERIFIED
MERGED
PUSHED
TESTED
AUTHORIZED
```

without corresponding evidence.

Do not infer state from:

- chat memory;
- intended commands;
- unexecuted tests;
- generated drafts;
- local files outside the repository;
- external repository claims;
- Card titles;
- prior agent summaries.

Prefer:

```text
NOT VERIFIED
PENDING
BLOCKED
```

when proof is absent.

---

## 34. Current Safe Resume Point

```text
Safe Resume:
Final Harness is canonicalized and verified at the current TraID root.
Git is not initialized. No implementation has started. Next step is
Git/repository baseline preparation followed by explicit human approval before
V1-C01.

Implementation Card: NONE
Repository Write Authorization: NONE
Next Roadmap Card: V1-C01
V1-C01 Authorization: NOT_GRANTED
```

Do not start V1-C01 until:

```text
all ten final Harness files are designed and cross-checked
→ files are prepared for actual repository installation
→ repository/Git reality is inspected
→ user explicitly approves V1-C01 start
```

---

## 35. Final Control Principle

```text
PROJECT_CONTROL RECORDS REAL STATE.
IT DOES NOT CREATE REALITY.

NO EVIDENCE → NO CLAIM.
NO APPROVAL → NO CONSEQUENTIAL ACTION.
NO ACTIVE CARD → NO IMPLEMENTATION.
CARD COMPLETE → STOP.
NEXT CARD → SEPARATE HUMAN APPROVAL.
```
